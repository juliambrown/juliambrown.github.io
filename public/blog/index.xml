      <description>I recently joined a project where progress was stalled because my collaborators were having trouble downloading their data from IMG, where it had been shared with them.
IMG is a great resource for microbial genomics data. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to work with a large amount of data, downloading directly through their interface may not be possible. Download times are long, and data files are too big to be reasonably stored on a personal machine.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website, I&amp;rsquo;m so happy you&amp;rsquo;ve stopped by to visit.
Let me introduce myself. I am a research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine, USA and a mother of two under 5.
The image for this post is a photo I took in March, 2021 at my favorite hiking spot. I try to visit this spot at least once a month regardless of the season, and use my time in the woods to reorganize my thoughts.</description>
