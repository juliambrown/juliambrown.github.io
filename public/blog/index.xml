      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m feeling as you would if you were to show up early to a good friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding. You know that there are a lot of logistics to coordinate and small crises to solve. You want to help, and to be a part of things, but you don&amp;rsquo;t really have a good picture of everything that needs to happen, and so the best thing to do is to stay out of the way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 3 in the morning on Friday, February 17th, we&amp;rsquo;ve been at sea for 10 days, and I can finally, happily say that I have samples in the freezer.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a surprisingly unruly journey to this point. I told you about logistics in the last post, but since then we encountered really active, windy seas and a bout of norovirus that raged through the science party. The combination was intense, and really not very fun.</description>

      <description>About a year ago, my friend and collaborator, Maria, approached me about joining a research cruise she was leading to the Eastern Tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone. She was leading a very comprehensive project looking at microbe-driven biogeochemical processes, and wanted to add a virus component to the project. She was wondering if I could be the person to make that happen.
I&amp;rsquo;d recently returned to work after maternity leave, and with a infant at home, my immediate reaction was, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website, I&amp;rsquo;m so happy you&amp;rsquo;ve stopped by to visit.
Let me introduce myself. I am a research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine, USA and a mother of two under 5.
The image for this post is a photo I took in March, 2021 at my favorite hiking spot. I try to visit this spot at least once a month regardless of the season, and use my time in the woods to reorganize my thoughts.</description>
