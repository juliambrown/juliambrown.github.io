      <title>How do I get the data: IMG</title>

      <description>IMG is a great resource for microbial genomics data. To do a big metaanalysis, or even to download metagenomic reads, it&amp;rsquo;s often necessary to work outside of their web user interface. Download times are long, and data files are too big to be reasonably stored on a personal machine.
Options, as outlined by IMG, are either using a Globus endpoint for downloading data, or using the API. Globus requires a subscription, which we do not have at our institution.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website, I&amp;rsquo;m so happy you&amp;rsquo;ve stopped by to visit.
Let me introduce myself. I am a research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine, USA and a mother of two under 5.
The image for this post is a photo I took in March, 2021 at my favorite hiking spot. I try to visit this spot at least once a month regardless of the season, and use my time in the woods to reorganize my thoughts.</description>

      <description>Hello! I am a Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences focused on understanding the roles of microbes and viruses using bioinformatics techniques.
I earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to take a position as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine.</description>

      <description>When you step into the ocean on planet Earth, you are stepping into an ocean of viruses. Roughly 50 million viruses are suspended within every teaspoon of seawater. The vast majority of these viruses infect microscopic organisms. Their complex relationship with hosts, ecosystems and biogeochemistry make them one of the least understood components of environments around the globe.
The image at the top of this page is a microscopy slide created from half a teaspoon of seawater.</description>
