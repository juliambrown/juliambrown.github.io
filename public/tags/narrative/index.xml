      <description>Hello! I am a Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.
My background. I earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to take a position as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. For SCGC, I took on an array of responsibilities and research, from maintaining and scripting for the center&amp;rsquo;s Laboratory Information Management System, to developing, updating and maintaining standardized bioinformatics workflows.</description>
