      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Julia (I also go by &amp;ldquo;Julie&amp;rdquo;), I am  a Senior Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences and leader of the Blue Bioinformatics Lab. My research interests lie in understanding the roles of microbes and viruses using integrative informatics techniques that merge information on microbial and viral genomic diversity and activity with environmental variability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some may say I took a &amp;ldquo;non-traditional route&amp;rdquo; to arrive in my current role, I&amp;rsquo;d say I followed my own path. I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Cornell University. I then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to hone my computational skills and gain experience in Single Cell Genomics as the Bioinformatician for the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. As a Bioinformatician for SCGC, I worked with many different scientists to pursue questions related to microbial and viral genomics and found great joy in making bioinformatics and computational problems more approachable through working with post docs, running coding workshops, engaging with local youth through Girls Who Code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
