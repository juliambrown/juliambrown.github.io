      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a two year job search, I am excited to share that I&amp;rsquo;ve begun a new position at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences as a Senior Research Scientist where I am starting a new research program and lab group. Research in my lab will be focused on integrative, big data approaches to understanding (mostly) marine microbial and viral ecology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am transitioning this website from a personal professional page to a lab website. Checkout the &amp;ldquo;Research&amp;rdquo; tab for an overview of ongoing research projects in the lab. Checkout the &amp;ldquo;Team&amp;rdquo; tag to learn about lab team members and opportunities to join my group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brown will be recruiting an experienced research associate or post doc to join the team within the next 6 months for a two year position investigating marine viruses in low oxygen systems and other areas of marine viral ecology and genomics. If you are interested please email julia [at] bigelow [dot] org.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Modelling Ocean Microbes using Satellites</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Satellite oceanography has revolutionized our ability to study phytoplankton communities and organic matter in the oceans across large spatial scales and time, yet there remains a gap in the ability to monitor and predict the diversity of the microbial communities that underpin ocean food webs using satellite observational tools. This matters because experimental and observational studies indicate that the source, quality, and quantity of organic matter influences taxonomic and functional diversity changes of microbial communities, which in turn affects biogeochemical cycling, so the strength of this correlation needs to be better understood for modeling responses to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
