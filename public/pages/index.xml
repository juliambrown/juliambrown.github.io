      <description>Hello! I am a Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences focused on understanding the roles of microbes and viruses using multi-omics techniques.
I earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to take a position as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine.</description>

      <description>When you step into the ocean on planet Earth, you are stepping into an ocean of viruses. Roughly 50 million viruses are suspended within every teaspoon of seawater. The vast majority of these viruses infect microscopic organisms. Their complex relationship with hosts, ecosystems and biogeochemistry make them one of the least understood components of environments around the globe.
The image at the top of this page is a microscopy slide created from half a teaspoon of seawater.</description>
