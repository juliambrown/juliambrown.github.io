To do a big metaanalysis, or even to download metagenomic reads, it\u0026rsquo;s often necessary to work outside of their web user interface. Download times are long, and data files are too big to be reasonably stored on a personal machine.\nOptions, as outlined by IMG, are either using a Globus endpoint for downloading data, or using the API. Globus requires a subscription, which we do not have at our institution.","date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/blog/img_api/","tags":null,"title":"How do I get the data: IMG"},{"author":"Julia Brown","categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to my website, I\u0026rsquo;m so happy you\u0026rsquo;ve stopped by to visit.\nLet me introduce myself.

Roughly 50 million viruses are suspended within every teaspoon of seawater. The vast majority of these viruses infect microscopic organisms. Their complex relationship with hosts, ecosystems and biogeochemistry make them one of the least understood components of environments around the globe.\nThe image at the top of this page is a microscopy slide created from half a teaspoon of seawater.","date":"2022-01-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/pages/research/","tags":["research"],"title":"Research"}]
