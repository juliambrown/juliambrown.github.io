I am a Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.\nMy background. I earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to take a position as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. For SCGC, I took on an array of responsibilities and research, from maintaining and scripting for the center\u0026rsquo;s Laboratory Information Management System, to developing, updating and maintaining standardized bioinformatics workflows.","date":"2022-01-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/pages/about/","tags":["about me","narrative"],"title":"About"},{"author":"Julia Brown","categories":null,"contents":"The image at the top of this page is a microscopy slide created from half a teaspoon of seawater.
