If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to work with a large amount of data, downloading directly through their interface may not be possible. Download times are long, and data files are too big to be reasonably stored on a personal machine.","date":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/blog/img_api/","tags":null,"title":"Getting data: IMG"},{"author":"Julia Brown","categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to my website, I\u0026rsquo;m so happy you\u0026rsquo;ve stopped by to visit.\nLet me introduce myself. I am a research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine, USA and a mother of two under 5.\nThe image for this post is a photo I took in March, 2021 at my favorite hiking spot. I try to visit this spot at least once a month regardless of the season, and use my time in the woods to reorganize my thoughts.","date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/blog/my-first-post/","tags":null,"title":"First Post"},{"author":"Julia Brown","categories":null,"contents":"Hello! I am a Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences focused on understanding the roles of microbes and viruses using multi-omics techniques.\nI earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

Roughly 50 million viruses are suspended within every teaspoon of seawater. The vast majority of these viruses infect microscopic organisms. Their complex relationship with hosts, ecosystems and biogeochemistry make them one of the least understood components of environments around the globe.\nThe image at the top of this page is a microscopy slide created from half a teaspoon of seawater.","date":"2022-01-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/pages/research/","tags":["research"],"title":"Research"}]
