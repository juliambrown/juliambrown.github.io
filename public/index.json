When the sampling ramped up on the ETNP cruise, leisure time for pet projects, and reflection all but disappeared. It was a good cruise, and I came back from the field with a great new network of collaborators and friends, and more samples than anticipated.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happened since? So nice of you to ask.

I told you about logistics in the last post, but since then we encountered really active, windy seas and a bout of norovirus that raged through the science party. The combination was intense, and really not very fun.","date":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/blog/water/","tags":null,"title":"Water"},{"author":"Julia Brown","categories":null,"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;m feeling as you would if you were to show up early to a good friend\u0026rsquo;s wedding.

She was wondering if I could be the person to make that happen.\nI\u0026rsquo;d recently returned to work after maternity leave, and with a infant at home, my immediate reaction was, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t.","date":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://juliambrown.github.io/blog/to_sea/","tags":null,"title":"Boarding Atlantis"},{"author":"Julia Brown","categories":null,"contents":"Welcome to my website, I\u0026rsquo;m so happy you\u0026rsquo;ve stopped by to visit.\nLet me introduce myself.
