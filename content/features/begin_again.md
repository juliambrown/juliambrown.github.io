After a two year job search, I am excited to share that I've begun a new position at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences as a Senior Research Scientist where I am starting a new research program and lab group. Research in my lab will be focused on integrative, big data approaches to understanding (mostly) marine microbial and viral ecology.

I am transitioning this website from a personal professional page to a lab website. Checkout the "Research" tab for an overview of ongoing research projects in the lab. Checkout the "Team" tag to learn about lab team members and opportunities to join my group.
