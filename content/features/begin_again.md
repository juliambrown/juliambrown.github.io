I am excited to share that I've begun a new position at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences as a Senior Research Scientist. This is a big change in roles, as I now have the resouces I need to build an independent lab group and research program. I am thus transitioning this website from a personal one to a lab website. 

And even more exciting is that I'm hitting the ground running. We are actively collecting samples for a [NASA-funded research project](/en/projects/microbes_from_space) underway in collaboration with the Marine Optics Lab at Bigelow. Check-out [this article](https://www.bigelow.org/news/articles/2025-06-26.html) in Bigelow's Transect Magazine for a write-up on the story behind getting this research off the ground. 

There is plenty of research that is currently simmering, some highlighted on the [Research](/en/projects/) page. And my lab is already a team of two thanks to [Tim](/en/people/tim/), who is providing his expertise in field work, microbiology and bioinformatics for the new NASA project. I'm anticipating an opportunity to grow my group in the next six months. Checkout the [Team](/en/people/) page to learn about opportunities to join my group. 

Research in my lab will be focused on integrative, big data approaches to understanding (mostly) marine microbial and viral ecology. I'm still workshopping the name for my research group, but for now an calling it the "Blue Bioinformatics Lab". "Blue" in reference to the marine systems that I study which are often dominated by the unseen majority of microbes and viruses, and "Bioinformatics" to acknowlage the predominant approach that my group will use to interrogate these blue systems. 

Stay tuned!
