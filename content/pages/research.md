When you step into the ocean on planet Earth, you are stepping into an ocean of viruses. Roughly 50 million viruses are suspended within every teaspoon of seawater. The vast majority of these viruses infect microscopic organisms. Their complex relationship with hosts, ecosystems and biogeochemistry make them one of the least understood components of environments around the globe.

The image at the top of this page is a microscopy slide created from half a teaspoon of seawater. In this image, the larger dots are bacteria. The smaller dots, resembling distant stars within the frame, are viruses. There about 10 times as many viruses in this image as bacteria, though one may note that there are lot of both.

My research interests lie in taking full advantage of existing data, current and emerging technologies to learn about viruses and microbes, often combining genomics data with other 'omics information and associated metadata. I take a big data approach utilizing old, new and my own bioinformatics tools on large data sets to uncover connections and relationships to gain a deeper understanding of environmental microbes and viruses, what they are capable of, and the nature of their interactions.

Environmental 'omics data is rich with information, particularly if layered together, offering much more contextual information than any one data type on its own.
