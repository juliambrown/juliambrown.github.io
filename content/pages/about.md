Hello! I am a Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. 

**My background.** I earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to take a position as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine. For SCGC, I took on an array of responsibilities and research, from maintaining and scripting for the center's Laboratory Information Management System, to developing, updating and maintaining standardized bioinformatics workflows. I've worked on original research as well as on projects for academic and industry collaborators. 

Through the years, I have had the priveledge of working with many different scientists to pursue questions related to microbial and viral genomics. I find great joy in collaboration to to make bioinformatics and computational problems and questions more approachable. I have experience teaching coding as a certified Carpentries instructor. 

**My mission.** As of July, 2022 I began a new role as a Research Scientist. In this role, I will be using my deep experience in microbiology, genomics, bioinformatics and data management in pursuit of interesting, innovative and impactful science. In this new role, I am actively seeking partnerships and collaborations so please don't hesitate to get in touch.
