Julia (who also goes by "Julie") is a Senior Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences focused on understanding the roles of microbes and viruses using integrative informatics to merge information on microbial and viral diversity activity with environmental parameters.

Julia earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, she pivoted from the traditional academic route to hone her computational experience as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine, before moving back into a Research Scientist role in 2022.   

Julia has worked with many different scientists to pursue questions related to microbial and viral genomics and finds great joy in making bioinformatics and computational problems more approachable.
