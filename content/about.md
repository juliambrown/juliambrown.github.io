Hello! I am a Senior Research Scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences focused on understanding the roles of microbes and viruses using integrative informatics to merge information on microbial and viral diversity activity with environmental parameters.

I earned a PhD in Microbiology from Cornell, then held a year-long postdoctoral position at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. From there, I pivoted from the traditional academic route to hone my computational experience as a Bioinformatician at the Single Cell Genomics Center at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, Maine, before moving back into a Research Scientist role in 2022.

Through the years, I have had the priviledge of working with many different scientists to pursue questions related to microbial and viral genomics. Iâ€™ve worked on original research as well as on projects for academic and industry collaborators. I find great joy in making bioinformatics and computational problems more approachable.

As of July 2025 I am building a new lab at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. I aim to use my deep experience in microbiology, genomics, bioinformatics and data management to pursue interesting, innovative and impactful science.
