Welcome to my website, I'm so happy you've stopped by to visit.

As this website is fresh, and I am not yet sure where I plan to take it, I will begin it all by introducing myself. I am a research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine, USA and a mother of two little girls, regretably trying to do it all. 

The image for this post is a photo I took in March, 2021 at my favorite hiking spot. I try to visit this spot at least once a month regardless of the season, and use my time in the woods to reorganize my thoughts. I hope to use this site in a similar way, revisiting it regularly to share what I'm excited about and reflect on how things are going.

I also hope to use this space to highlight computational challenges and solutions I encounter as I work through my research.
