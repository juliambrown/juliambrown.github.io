At 5 in the morning on Friday, February 17th, after 10 days sea, and I put my first samples in the freezer.

It's been a surprisingly unruly journey to this point. I told you about logistics in the last post, but since then we encountered really active, windy seas and a bout of norovirus that raged through the science party. The combination was intense, and really not very fun. After about 4 days of transit the virus had run its course, the seas turned calm and the science party was able to regain our sea legs, stomachs and enthusiasm for the trip.

We reached our target site, a location not too far off of the coast of Mexico, at 17:00 Wednesday evening. The first act was to cast out the CTD for a water column profile to check to see if we'd, indeed, reached the ENTP Oxygen Minimum Zone. Sure enough, at around 50 meters below the surface our oxygen sensors showed oxygen levels below the limits of detection, confirming that we were floating on top of a watermass effectively devoid of oxygen.

The OMZ off the coast of Mexico is a permanent feature of the ocean. Such zones exist around the world, some occurring naturally and others due to anthropogenic (human) influences. Important steps in the global cycling of nutrients, particularly cycling of nitrogen and sulfur, happen within OMZs. In a warming ocean, the capacity to hold dissolved oxygen will decrease, and oxygen minimum zones like the one we're studying will likely expand.

Oxygen minimum zones are often referred to as "dead zones" because it is challenging to impossible for organisms that respire (a.k.a breathe) oxygen, such as fish, to live in such zones. But OMZs are not devoid of life. Many microbes thrive without oxygen and these populations are what drive the cycling of nitrogen and sulfur within OMZs. Microbes are also what the majority of scientists on the ship are focused on.

The water sampling fest began immediately upon arrival, but I did not get on the schedule, allowing me to get a good night sleep before what turned into a very long day. The first morning, *in situ* incubators were deployed. Attached to a floating mooring, they were set adrift, dangling 200 meters below the surface. These instruments are being used to conduct experiments at depth with water sucked straight in from the OMZ. When you study low oxygen environments, bringing samples on deck and conducting experiments immediately disrupts what was going on naturally. By running experiments in floating incubators, experiments are close as possible to exact conditions.

My goal for this expedition is not to run experiments, but just to collect samples to analyze in the coming months. My chance for water didn't come until 17:00 on the second day on site, much later than expected but very welcome when it finally came. This began a 15 hour shift sampling, then filtering, filtering, filtering. My schedule for the rest of the station was a bit more reasonable, I became a regular of the 5:30am CTD cast for water collection, which allowed me to work through the day, and be done by dinner time, often to return to the lab after to set everything up to do it again the following morning. To be honest, as a mom of two under 4, this schedule has worked, and to some extent I feel more rested working around the clock on the ship than I have many days as a parent.
