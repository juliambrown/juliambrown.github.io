Best laid plans of keeping up a blog have eluded me, as they often do. When the sampling ramped up on the ETNP cruise, leisure time for pet projects, and reflection all but disappeared.  It was a good cruise, and I came back from the field with a great new network of collaborators and friends, and more samples than anticipated.

What's happened since? So nice of you to ask. Here's a round up of some public facing activities:

* While I was at sea, I was interviewed by Quanta Magazine about the [consumption of viruses by unicellular eukaryotes](https://www.quantamagazine.org/with-nothing-to-eat-except-viruses-some-microbes-thrive-20230221/)

* In the spring, I hosted the [2023 GORG Bioinformatics Jamboree](https://bigelowlab.github.io/2023-GORG-jamboree/), a bioinformatics workshop focused on the GORG collection of single cell genomes, in collaboration with Ramunas Stepanauskas and the Single Cell Genomics Center

* [An essay about my time at sea](https://www.bigelow.org/files/transect/transect-summer-2023.pdf) was published in Bigelow's Transect magazine

* I co-presented a [Cafe Scientifique public lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuMbRV_2I3A) with Catherine Mitchell on some of the early work we've done pairing microbial genomics data with satellite data

* I co-instructed a Data Carpentry workshop focused on using [python for Ecology](https://smcclatchy.github.io/2023-06-05-colby/) at Colby College

* Later that summer, I presented a Ocean Hack Week tutorial on [Meta-omics Analyses for Ocean Science](https://oceanhackweek.org/ohw23/tutorials/03-Thu/OHW_omics_lesson.html) 

On the back side, lots of science and adventure is cooking. More on that later.
