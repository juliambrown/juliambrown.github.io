IMG is a great resource for microbial genomics data. To do a big metaanalysis, or even to download metagenomic reads, it's often necessary to work outside of their web user interface. Download times are long, and data files are too big to be reasonably stored on a personal machine.

Options, as outlined by IMG, are either using a [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) endpoint for downloading data, or using the API. Globus requires a subscription, which we do not have at our institution. After a little bit of playing around and leaning into IMG's instructions, I was able to get everything we needed using the API.

All of the information required is available through their [download instructions]().

More soon on how we solved this...
